## ‚úÖ Example Courses That MEET RSI

| **Course Design** | **RSI Categories Met** |
|------------------|----------------------|
| **Example 1:** Weekly concept announcements + Q&A discussion board monitoring + Graded assignments with comments | ‚úì Providing information/questions<br>‚úì Assessment & feedback |
| **Example 2:** Weekly problem sets with class-level feedback announcements + Individual test feedback + Weekly office hours | ‚úì Assessment & feedback<br>‚úì Providing information/questions |
| **Example 3:** Weekly discussion board participation + Weekly office hours + Essay feedback on exams | ‚úì Facilitating discussion<br>‚úì Providing information/questions |
| **Example 4:** Required instructor meeting for goals + Weekly journal with instructor comments/prompts | ‚úì Assessment & feedback<br>‚úì Providing information/questions |
| **Example 5:** Bi-weekly collaborative documents + Draft feedback or graded assignments | ‚úì Facilitating discussion<br>‚úì Assessment & feedback |

## ‚ùå Example Courses That DO NOT Meet RSI

| **Course Design** | **Why It Fails** | **How to Fix** |
|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Videos + Auto-graded quizzes + Graded midterm/final + Office hours | Only meets ONE category | Add regular feedback OR facilitate discussions |
| Auto-graded homework + Graded exams + Due date announcements | No regular instructor interaction | Add content announcements + instructor-graded components + office hours |
| Auto-graded activities + Due date reminders + Available for calls | Only meets ONE category | Add instructor-graded components + content study sessions |

## üìã Syllabus Requirements

For **asynchronous courses** (no set meeting times), include:

### Sample Syllabus Statement:
> "This course is fully asynchronous and has no set meeting times; you will have course activities and due dates throughout the term. I will substantively interact with you through regular **[class discussion boards, announcements that provide class feedback and direction, individual feedback on your projects, and optional study sessions]**."

*Update bracketed section based on your specific course design*

## üîë Key Reminders

1. **Two categories minimum** - Must have regular activities from at least 2 RSI categories
2. **Content-focused** - Interactions must be about academic content, not just logistics
3. **Instructor-initiated** - Don't wait for student requests; proactively engage
4. **Regular schedule** - Make interactions predictable and frequent
