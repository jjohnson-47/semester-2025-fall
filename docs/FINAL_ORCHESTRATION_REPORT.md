## 🚀 What Works Right Now

### V1.1.0 Schema Validation
```bash
make validate-v110
# ✓ MATH221: schedule.json valid v1.1.0-compatible
# ✓ MATH251: schedule.json valid v1.1.0-compatible  
# ✓ STAT253: schedule.json valid v1.1.0-compatible
```

### No Weekend Due Dates (Systematic Enforcement)
```bash
BUILD_MODE=v2 make schedules
# ✓ MATH221: No weekend due dates (checked 15 weeks)
# ✓ MATH251: No weekend due dates (checked 15 weeks) 
# ✓ STAT253: No weekend due dates (checked 15 weeks)
```

### Enhanced Projections with Formatted Due Dates
```bash
# Week 1: Functions, Operations on Functions, Linear Functions
#   - MyOpenMath: Sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 (due Fri 08/29)
#   - Blackboard Discussion: Getting Registered & Introductions (due Wed 08/27)
```

### Complete Build Pipeline with Reports
```bash
make pipeline
# ✓ Pipeline run complete
# Generated: build/projection/, build/reports/, build/normalized/
```

### Full Provenance Tracking
```json
{
  "_meta": {
    "stable_id": "math221-fall-2025-aee03ee8",
    "checksum": "897504c64375b49d...",
    "provenance": [
      {
        "rule": "stable_id_migration_v2", 
        "transformation_count": 34
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### V2 Cutover Validation
```bash
make v2-cutover-dry-run
# ✓ V2 preview generated
# ✓ Schema validation passed  
# ✓ MATH221: No weekend due dates
# ✓ MATH251: No weekend due dates
# ✓ STAT253: No weekend due dates
# ✓ Dry-run complete - V2 ready for cutover
```

## 🔧 Technical Achievements

### 1. **Complete Non-Breaking Migration**
- All existing functionality preserved
- BUILD_MODE flag provides instant rollback
- Legacy builders continue working unchanged
- Gradual migration path fully implemented

### 2. **Enterprise-Grade Data Model**

```

### 3. **Systematic Rule Enforcement**
```python
# No weekend due dates systematically enforced
def apply_rules(self, date: datetime, assignment_type: AssignmentType) -> datetime:
    if self.is_weekend(date):
        date = self.shift_from_weekend(date, direction="before")  # To Friday
    return date
```

### 4. **Deterministic Builds**
```python
# Stable IDs ensure reproducible builds
stable_id = create_stable_id("MATH221", "Fall", 2025)
# Always produces: "math221-fall-2025-aee03ee8"
```
