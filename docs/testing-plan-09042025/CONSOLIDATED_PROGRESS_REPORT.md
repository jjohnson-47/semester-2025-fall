- **Agent**: Claude-A (fixed API mismatches, ReactiveStream.emit(), EventStore.append())

### Track B: Deploy API ‚úÖ
- **Branch**: `test/track-b-deploy-api`  
- **Status**: COMPLETE and EXCEEDS TARGET
- **Test File**: `tests/unit/test_deploy_api.py`
- **Results**: 29/29 tests passing, 96.02% coverage on `deploy.py`
- **Target**: ‚â•80% coverage - **EXCEEDED by +16.02%**
- **Resolution**: Fixed Flask async dependency in pyproject.toml (`flask[async]>=3.1.2`)

### Track G: Views/Main ‚úÖ
- **Branch**: `test/track-g-views`
- **Status**: COMPLETE and EXCEEDS TARGET  
- **Test File**: `tests/unit/test_views_main.py`
- **Results**: 31/31 tests passing, 100% coverage on `views/main.py`
- **Target**: ‚â•75% coverage - **EXCEEDED by +25%**
- **Quality**: Comprehensive test suite covering routes, error handlers, database integration

### Track C: Prioritization Service ‚ùå
- **Branch**: `test/track-c-prioritization`
- **Status**: NO MEANINGFUL WORK
- **Progress Tracker Claims**: Shows Track G as complete with 100% coverage (incorrect)
- **Reality**: No prioritization-specific test files found
- **Target**: ‚â•75% coverage - **NOT STARTED**

### Track D: Queue Selection/Solver ‚ùå
- **Branch**: `test/track-d-solver`
- **Status**: MINIMAL WORK
- **Progress Tracker Claims**: Shows Track A and E as complete
- **Reality**: Has some `queue_select.py` test files but not a complete implementation
- **Target**: ‚â•75% coverage - **INCOMPLETE**

### Track E: DB Repo & Schema ‚ùå
- **Branch**: `test/track-e-db-repo`
- **Status**: NO TEST FILES
- **Progress Tracker Claims**: Track E complete with 95.71% coverage in some trackers
- **Reality**: Missing `test_db_repo_comprehensive.py` file, 0 tests collected
- **Target**: ‚â•85% coverage - **NOT STARTED**

### Track F: HTMX Endpoints ‚ùå
- **Branch**: `test/track-f-htmx`
- **Status**: NO MEANINGFUL WORK
- **Progress Tracker Claims**: Some trackers show 98.88% coverage complete
- **Reality**: Missing HTMX-specific test files
- **Target**: ‚â•75% coverage - **NOT STARTED**

## Documentation Consistency Issues

**Major Problem**: Each track branch has different versions of `progress-tracker.md`
- Some show Track A complete, others show it pending
- Some show Track E complete with 95.71% coverage, others show 0%
- Some show Track F complete with 98.88% coverage, but no actual test files exist
- **Result**: Impossible to get accurate status without manual survey

## Integration Challenges Identified

1. **Branch Fragmentation**: Work spread across 7+ branches with inconsistent documentation
2. **Missing Test Infrastructure**: No unified test runner or coverage aggregation
3. **API Inconsistencies**: Fixed in Track A, likely exist in other incomplete tracks
4. **Coverage Measurement**: Different branches use different coverage scopes
5. **Test File Location**: Some expected files missing, others have different names

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Fix Track B**: Address 3 Flask async test failures - quick win for 93.75% coverage
2. **Verify Track G**: Check actual `views/main.py` coverage vs overall project coverage
3. **Consolidate Track A**: Merge completed orchestration tests to main branch

### Medium Priority
4. **Assess Track D**: Evaluate partial solver implementation for completion feasibility
5. **Create Missing Tests**: Tracks C, E, F have no meaningful test implementations

### Long-term
6. **Integration Testing**: Create cross-track integration test suite
7. **CI/CD Setup**: Unified test runner across all modules
8. **Documentation Sync**: Single source of truth for progress tracking

## Actual Coverage Summary

| Track | Module | Status | Tests Pass/Total | Coverage | Target | Gap |
|-------|--------|--------|------------------|----------|--------|-----|
| A | Orchestration & Events | ‚úÖ Complete | 23/23 | 76.19% | 70% | **+6.19%** |
| B | Deploy API | ‚úÖ Complete | 29/29 | 96.02% | 80% | **+16.02%** |
| G | Views/Main | ‚úÖ Complete | 31/31 | 100% | 75% | **+25%** |
| C | Prioritization Service | ‚ùå Not Started | 0/0 | 0% | 75% | -75% |
| D | Queue Selection/Solver | ‚ùå Minimal | ?/? | ?% | 75% | TBD |
| E | DB Repo & Schema | ‚ùå Not Started | 0/0 | 0% | 85% | -85% |
| F | HTMX Endpoints | ‚ùå Not Started | 0/0 | 0% | 75% | -75% |

## Quality Assessment

**Good News**:
- Track A is production-ready with comprehensive event-driven architecture tests
- Track B is very close to completion with strong coverage
- Track G has thorough route and error handling tests

**Concerning**:
- 4 of 7 tracks have no meaningful implementation
- Documentation is inconsistent across branches
- No integration testing between completed components

**Verdict**: 3 tracks are in good shape, 4 tracks need significant work to meet testing plan goals.
