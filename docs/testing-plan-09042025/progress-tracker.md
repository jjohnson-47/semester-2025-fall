## Commands Log

```bash
# Track 0 - Started at [time]
claude-code "You are implementing Track 0 test infrastructure..."

# Track A - Started at [time]
# [command will be added when launched]

# Track B - Started at [time]
# [command will be added when launched]
```

## Notes

- Track 0 must complete before any other tracks can start
- Prioritize Track A (Orchestration) and Track C (Prioritization) once unblocked
- Track B (Deploy API) is the "quick win" - should complete fastest
- Run coverage checks every 4 hours
- Document any flaky tests immediately
